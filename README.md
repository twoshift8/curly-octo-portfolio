# Code Samples 

This folder includes a few Python scripts I made in Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science. This showcases some Python scripts which demonstrate skills in data validation, string manipulation, algorithmic problem-solving, etc.

## Included Projects

- **bank.py**: Responds to user greetings with context-aware logic.
    - String handling and decision logic
    - Context (Seinfeld): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN6cJ_wGmsk
- **interpreter.py**: Parses and evaluates simple mathematical expressions from user input. 
    - Parsing and control flow.
- **nutrition.py**: Maps food items to nutritional values using dictionaries. 
    - Structured data handling.
- **outdated.py**: Converts various date formats (e.g. “March 1, 1999” or “3/1/1999”) to ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).
    Robust input parsing with exception handling.
- **plates.py**: Validates custom license plate input based on complex rules.
    - Algorithmic thinking and input validation.
- **twttr.py**: Removes vowels from input text.
    - Text processing and transformation.

Still learning, but these are some projects which reflect my ability to pick up new tools quickly and translate logic into working code.
