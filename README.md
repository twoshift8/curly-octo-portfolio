Some of my projects


# Code Samples 

This folder includes selected Python scripts from my coursework in Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science. This showcases some of my Python scripts which demonstrate skills in data validation, string manipulation, and algorithmic problem-solving, relevant for research and computational roles.

## Included Projects

- **plates.py**: Validates custom license plate input according to complex rules. Demonstrates algorithmic thinking and input validation.
- **nutrition.py**: Maps food items to nutritional values using dictionaries. Demonstrates structured data handling.
- **interpreter.py**: Parses and evaluates simple mathematical expressions from user input. Demonstrates parsing and control flow.
- **bank.py**: Responds to user greetings with context-aware logic. Demonstrates string handling and decision logic.
- **twttr.py**: Removes vowels from input text. Demonstrates text processing and transformation.


Iâ€™m still learning, but these are a few projects which reflect my ability to pick up new tools quickly, think through structured problems, and translate logic into working code.
