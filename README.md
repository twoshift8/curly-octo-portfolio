Some of my projects


# Code Samples 

This folder includes selected Python scripts from my coursework in Harvard's CS50 Introduction to Computer Science. I'm submitting these as representative samples of my current programming ability and approach to analytical problem-solving. These files demonstrate how I’ve applied foundational Python skills to text analysis, pattern recognition, and algorithmic logic—relevant to research involving data-driven or computational components.

## `readability.py`
Implements the Coleman-Liau index to determine the grade level of a given text. The program counts letters, words, and sentences to produce a readability score.

### Key Concepts:
- Text parsing
- Control flow
- User input handling

While I’m still learning, these projects reflect my ability to pick up new tools quickly, think through structured problems, and translate logic into working code. I’m eager to keep building on these foundations in a research environment.
